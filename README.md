**"Hey you. Yeah you! Do you fat-finger release when you're supposed to be waiting on a recovery rez? Good job dummy...  you could probably use an addon to keep you from doing that, eh?"**

### **Meet DontReleaseDummy**

We've all been there. Your raid wiped at at 2%, and everyone is itching to get back and try again, but you accidentally click "Release Spirit" out of habit and everyone now has to stand around waiting on you. **DontReleaseDummy** fixes your "Release Reflex" by locking the button behind a short, customizable hold-timer.

*   **The Lock:** When you die, the Release button is disabled.
*   **The Key:** Hold **Control (Ctrl)** to start the unlock countdown.
*   **The Timer:** A countdown appears below the buttons so you know exactly when it's safe to click.

**Configuration:**

*   `/drd time 3` — Set the hold duration to 3 seconds (or whatever you prefer).
*   `/drd instance` — Toggle protection so it only works in Dungeons/Raids.
